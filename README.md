Place your BCSAR files inside the main folder with the script, then run it. The resulting SF2 files will be placed in the `output` folder.

The programs used are as follows:
* vgmstream
* Soneek's Wii3DSUSoundTool
* sf2comp
* cseq2midi

Thanks!

Remember that this is a fork, so give the original tools some love too.

(Results may vary depending on the bcsar)
